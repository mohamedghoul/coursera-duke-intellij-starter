# Duke University Java Course Starter Project for IntelliJ IDEA

This repository was created to address a common issue for students of Duke Univeristy's Java Courses on Coursera who prefer using IntelliJ IDEA over BlueJ as their IDE.  

This repository contains a starter project for IntelliJ IDEA that can be used to complete the assignments for the course. The project contains the same package structure as the BlueJ projects, including all the necessary packages provided by Duke University. The only difference is that the project is configured to use IntelliJ IDEA instead of BlueJ.

## Notice  
This starter project is currently compatible with JDK 21 from Oracle. However, if a different JDK is used, the project can be reconfigured to use it by following the instructions below.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
3. Open the `Project Structure` window by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + S` or by navigating to `File > Project Structure`.
4. Under `Project Settings`, select `Project`.
5. Under `Project SDK`, select the JDK you wish to use.
